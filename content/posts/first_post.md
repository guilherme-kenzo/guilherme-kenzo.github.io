# Introduction to the blog

This blog will serve as a platform for my personal projects regarding software development, electronics, woodworking or any other of my hobbies. I might cross-post the content here, but my intention is to maintain this as my primary platform.

Most of the posts will be in portuguese, as my primary purpose is to share my projects with family and friends (who are mostly brazilian, as am I). I might experiment with manually translating some of the posts as well as using machine translation, but this will depend on my available time.

# Code, electronics, microcontrollers and woodworking

As previously stated, I will be posting about my hobbies. For professional related content, you should head to my companies blog: [Turivius Blog](https:///turivius.com/). And what are my hobbies?

## Software Development

This is where my hobbies intersect with my professional life. It might be strange, but  a big chunck of my free time I spend writing software -- as the CTO of my company, I end up writing less software than I would like. Learning new languages, trying out new open source projects and reading up on new technologies is how I try to keep up with the younger kids.

## Electronics and microcontrollers

This is somewhat related to software development. Though my knowledge is limited, I love playing around with electronics and programming microcontrollers since my early teens, when I started making guitar effect pedals and mini-amplifiers. Currently, I'm into home automation and using electronics to make my life easier.

## Woodworking

Woodworking is how I "detox" from the digital world. Mostly, I like using handtools to make small furniture (side tables, chairs ...). By all definitions, I am a amateur woodworker: not very skillfull but deeply enthusiastic.

I hope you enjoy!
